# User Journey: Collaborative Design Platform

## Overview

This platform helps teams collaborate to design and build websites together. The process guides teams through five stages: discussing ideas in a meeting, voting on the best approaches, individually creating design versions with AI help, reviewing everyone's work, and finally deploying the winning design. Throughout the entire process, team members can see and talk to each other via video conferencing.

---

## Stage 1: Meeting Room - Discussion and Brainstorming

The journey begins when someone creates a meeting room and shares a room ID with their team. Team members simply enter this room ID to join—the system automatically creates guest accounts for them, so there's no complicated sign-up process.

Once inside the Meeting Room, everyone sees a video conference interface similar to Zoom or Microsoft Teams. Team members can turn their cameras and microphones on or off, and they can share their screens to show examples, inspiration, or reference materials. The main focus is on having a natural discussion about the design project.

As people talk, everything is automatically transcribed in real-time. A transcript panel on the right side of the screen shows who said what and when. This means no one needs to worry about taking notes—the platform captures everything automatically. Team members can download this transcript later as a text file if they need it.

The Meeting Room also includes a chat feature with two modes. In regular chat mode, team members can send text messages to each other. In image generation mode, users can describe an image concept and the AI will generate it. For example, if someone wants to show what a blue gradient background might look like, they can switch to image mode, type their description, and share the generated image with the team.

The first person to join the room becomes the "Host" and gets special abilities that help guide the team through the process. When the team has finished their discussion and is ready to move forward, the host clicks a button to generate an AI summary. The AI reads through all the transcripts and creates an organized summary of what was discussed, categorizing everything into decisions made, actions needed, discussion topics, and questions that remain unanswered.

## Stage 2: Workflow Canvas - Navigation Hub

At any point during the session, any team member can click a "Workflow" button that appears on their screen. This takes them to a visual navigation hub called the Workflow Canvas.

The Workflow Canvas shows a flowchart with five connected nodes representing the five stages of the process: Meeting Room, Poll/Voting Room, Coding Mode, Code Review Room, and Exit. This visual map helps everyone understand where they currently are in the process and where they can go next.

The stages unlock sequentially. At the start, only the Meeting Room is accessible. After team members visit the Meeting Room, the Poll Room unlocks. After visiting the Poll Room, the Coding Room becomes available, and so on. This prevents teams from accidentally skipping important steps.

The host has a special control panel on the Workflow Canvas where they can enable or disable different stages. This gives the host control over when the team moves forward. For instance, the host might keep the Coding Room disabled until everyone has finished voting in the Poll Room.

The Workflow Canvas serves as a central hub that team members can return to whenever they want to navigate between stages. No one gets lost because they can always see where they are and where they can go.

## Stage 3: Poll and Voting Room - Deciding Together

After the host generates the AI summary, the team moves to the Poll and Voting Room. This stage helps the team review what was discussed and make democratic decisions about which ideas to pursue.

The Poll Room has two tabs. The first tab displays the AI-generated summary, showing all the key points from the meeting organized into categories. Team members can read through decisions that were made, actions that need to happen, general discussion points, and questions that don't have clear answers yet.

The second tab shows discussion points that can be voted on. Each team member can vote on each point by clicking "Agree," "Disagree," or "Neutral." The vote counts update in real-time, so everyone immediately sees how the team feels about each idea.

Only the host can add new discussion points, edit existing ones, or delete points that aren't relevant. This helps keep the voting organized and prevents the list from becoming chaotic. However, everyone can vote, ensuring that all team members have an equal say in the decisions.

After voting is complete, the host can generate an initial design using AI. Before generating, the host can customize the instructions given to the AI—essentially telling it exactly what kind of website to create based on the summary and voting results. When the host clicks "Generate Design," the AI creates the starting code for a website.

The platform then does something clever: it automatically creates a personal copy of this initial design for every team member. This means everyone starts from the same baseline, but each person will be able to make their own modifications without affecting anyone else's work.

---

## Stage 4: Coding Mode - Individual Creation

In the Coding Mode stage, each team member has their own personal workspace where they can customize the design. The screen is split into two main areas: a chat interface on the left and a live preview of the website on the right.

Team members don't need to know how to write code. Instead, they simply describe what they want in plain English by chatting with the AI. For example, someone might type: "Make the header blue and add a logo on the left side." The AI understands this request, writes the necessary code, and the preview immediately updates to show the changes.

Team members can continue making requests to refine their design. They might ask the AI to add a contact form, change button colors, create an image gallery, add animations, or adjust the layout. Each time, the AI generates the code and the preview updates instantly so they can see the results.

Because each person has their own independent workspace, team members can explore completely different design directions without worrying about conflicts. One person might create a bold, colorful design with lots of animations. Another might prefer a clean, minimal approach. Someone else might focus on adding advanced features like pricing tables or testimonial carousels.

Even though everyone is working independently, small video thumbnails of all team members remain visible at the top of the screen. Team members can unmute their microphones at any time to ask questions, share discoveries, or discuss ideas with the group.

When a team member is satisfied with their version, they click a "Save as Final Version" button. This stores their work and makes it available for review in the next stage. Team members can continue refining their design and save multiple times—only the most recent save counts as their final version.

---

## Stage 5: Code Review Room - Collaborative Selection

The Code Review Room is where the team comes together to evaluate everyone's work and choose the best design. The left side of the screen shows a list of all team members who saved a final version. When someone clicks on a name, that person's design appears in the main viewing area.

The team can see a live, interactive preview of each design and can click through to test how it works. They can also browse through the code files to see how it was built, though non-technical team members might focus more on the visual preview.

This stage includes a voting system where each team member can vote on each version. They can click a "Like" button if they think a version should be the winner, or a "Dislike" button if they don't think it should be chosen. When voting, team members can add comments explaining their reasoning. For example, someone might comment: "I love the color scheme and the animations are really smooth!" or "The features are great but the layout feels too crowded."

All votes and comments appear in real-time, so the entire team can see what everyone thinks about each version. Team members can continue their video discussion while reviewing, having conversations about what works well in each design and what could be improved.

After reviewing all versions and seeing all the votes and comments, the team makes a collective decision about which design should be deployed. If everyone agrees on a clear winner, that version can be deployed to the web with just a few clicks, creating a live website that anyone can visit.

If the team isn't fully satisfied with any version, or if they want to make changes based on the feedback they've seen, they can navigate back to the Coding Room using the Workflow button. They can make adjustments, save new final versions, and return to the Code Review Room to evaluate the updated designs.

## User Roles

### The Host

The host is simply the first person who joins the room—there's no special selection process. This person has additional responsibilities to help facilitate the process and keep things moving forward.

The host can generate the AI summary from the meeting transcript, which is necessary to transition from the Meeting Room to the Poll Room. In the Poll Room, the host can add, edit, and delete discussion points, giving them control over what the team votes on. The host also generates the initial AI design that all team members will start from when they enter their personal workspaces.

Throughout the process, the host controls which stages are enabled on the Workflow Canvas. This prevents the team from skipping ahead before completing necessary steps. For example, the host might wait to enable the Coding Room until voting is complete in the Poll Room.

Despite these special abilities, the host is also a regular participant. They join the video conference, participate in discussions, vote on discussion points, create their own design version in the Coding Room, and vote in the Code Review Room just like everyone else. The host role is about facilitation, not authority over final decisions.

### Participants

All other team members are participants. They have full access to participate in video conferencing, share their screens, view and download transcripts, use chat and image generation, and vote on discussion points. In the Coding Room, they have complete freedom to create whatever design they imagine. In the Code Review Room, they can review all versions and cast their votes with equal weight to everyone else's votes.

The main limitations for participants are that they cannot add or edit discussion points in the Poll Room, cannot generate the initial AI design, and cannot control which workflow stages are enabled. These tasks are reserved for the host to keep the process organized and prevent confusion.

This structure keeps the workflow organized while remaining democratic. The host facilitates the process, but every team member has an equal voice in decisions and an equal opportunity to contribute their creative vision.

## Example Journey: Website Redesign Project

To understand how this works in practice, imagine a team of four people working together to redesign a landing page for their company.

**The Team**: Alex (team lead, becomes host), Sarah (designer), John (developer), and Maria (product manager)

**Meeting Room**: Alex creates a room called "landing-page-redesign" and shares the room ID with the team. Everyone joins, turns on their cameras, and begins discussing. Maria explains they need a modern, professional landing page for a new product. Sarah suggests a clean design with lots of whitespace and a bold hero section at the top. John agrees and mentions they should include a features section and contact form. Maria shares her screen to show competitor examples. Sarah generates a few concept images showing different color schemes—the team agrees a blue gradient looks most professional. After 30 minutes of discussion, Alex generates an AI summary and the team moves to the Poll Room.

**Poll Room**: The team reviews the AI summary, which shows their main decisions (modern clean design, blue gradient, hero section, features section, contact form) and open questions (should they include testimonials? pricing table?). Sarah adds a discussion point about testimonials—the team votes and three agree it's important, so they'll include it. John adds a point about the pricing table—the vote is split, and after discussion they decide to skip it for now to keep the page focused. Alex generates an initial design from the summary, and the system creates a personal copy for each team member. They move to the Coding Room.

**Coding Mode**: Each team member works independently. Sarah focuses on making the design beautiful—she adds the blue-to-purple gradient, smooth animations, and polished hover effects. John adds the testimonials carousel they voted on and organizes the features section with icon cards. Maria experiments with including a pricing table despite the vote, wanting to see how it looks. Alex tries to combine elements from all their approaches, creating a comprehensive version with the gradient, testimonials, and responsive mobile design. After 40 minutes, everyone has saved their final versions and moves to Code Review.

**Code Review Room**: The team reviews each version. Sarah's is beautiful but minimal. John's has great features but less polished design. Maria's includes the pricing table but needs design refinement. Alex's version combines the gradient from Sarah's aesthetic, testimonials like John's version, full mobile responsiveness, and balanced features. The team votes and all four members choose Alex's version—it successfully combines the best elements from everyone's ideas. Alex deploys the winning design, and within minutes they have a live website. The entire process took two hours from start to finish.

## Why This Process Works

This platform succeeds because it balances structure with freedom. The five-stage workflow ensures teams follow a logical progression—discuss before deciding, decide before building, build before reviewing—but within each stage, participants have freedom to explore their ideas.

The AI assistance removes technical barriers. People who don't know how to code can fully participate in creating a functional website simply by describing what they want in plain language. This makes the design process accessible to everyone on the team, not just technical specialists.

The individual workspaces prevent conflicts. Traditional collaborative coding can be chaotic when multiple people try to edit the same files. Here, everyone experiments in their own sandbox, and the best ideas emerge naturally in the Code Review stage based on their merits.

The continuous video presence maintains human connection. Even when working independently, team members can see each other and communicate. This preserves the collaborative spirit of working together in the same room, even when physically apart.

The democratic voting system ensures every voice matters. Whether voting on discussion points or final designs, every team member has equal input. The best ideas win through team consensus, not individual authority or technical expertise.

Together, these elements create a process that is organized yet creative, technical yet accessible, independent yet collaborative. Teams can move from initial conversation to deployed website in a single efficient session while ensuring everyone meaningfully contributes to the final result.
